### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Through proper testing solutions, be it unit testing, autonomous testing, or testing through other means, you can ensure that your program has no bugs, mistakes, or logical errors, and ensure you create a program that always does what it is supposed to do.
### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I would ensure that the user has given you a proper list of requirements that the program must acheive, if possible double check with the user that nothing is missing and entirely design the program around those requirements. This ensures that you create a program that is exactly what the user needs.
### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is simple, I first think of what I want the software to do, and then I figure out the proper way to acheive that. I usually research different programming techniques that assist me in this process but above all I just ensure that I am creating something that alligns with what I need the software to be able to do.
